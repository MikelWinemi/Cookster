# Cookster
This is a recipe finding app, integrated with mealAPI
Welcome to the repository for **Cookster**, a recipe finder app built with **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**.

## About Cookster :memo:

Cookster is an intuitive and efficient recipe finder app that helps you discover and organize your favorite recipes. The app is built using Kotlin, a statically typed programming language that is fully interoperable with Java and Android. 

The UI of Cookster is designed using Jetpack Compose, a modern toolkit for building native Android UI. Jetpack Compose simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.

## How Cookster Works :mag:

Cookster uses **MealAPIs** to fetch a vast collection of recipes. When you search for a recipe, the app sends a request to the API with your search query. The API then returns a list of recipes that match your query. These recipes are then displayed in the app for you to browse and save.
